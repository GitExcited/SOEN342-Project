createOffering() in the system sequence diagram should have signature
(lesson, LOCATION, start time, endtime) instead of SCHEDULE. This is because
location HAS a schedule, so the organization is esentially asking to have a lesson
at a given location and then we check if that locatin's schedule works or not. 
^^^ There are other places this needs to be changed such as the sequence diagram for createOffering


The method ' takeOnOfferings()' has a real weird name for what it is supposed to do: 
It simply allows Instructor to VIEW the offerings published. so i renamed it to viewOfferings

In UML sequenceDiagram selectOffering, it makes no sense for Instructor to pass (Instructor, Offering). instead it should
pass (instructor, offeringID) where ID is some offering integer. This is because the Instructor doesnt have a way to 
'own' an offering, so can't pass it. at best he can select an id from those available after doing ViewOfferings()

"Once registered, an instructor can subsequently take on possibly several offerings that
the organization makes available. All offerings are made available to potential
instructors, but only those that have been taken by instructors are made available to the
public in order to attract clients.
" Implies that all offerings can be viewed by Instructor, not just public ones. So we need to rework UML
Sequence diagram takeOnOfferings ( soon to be called ViewOfferings)

Offerings doesn't actually have ANY way to view what the publicOfferings are with our current Implementation.
Thus the UML for TakeOnOfferings makes no sense. Instead, we simply assume that all offerings are the NONPUBLIC offerings
i.e. offerings not taken by any instructor. This simplifies a lot. Also this changes selectOffering quite a lot too :/



It really makes much more sense for publicOffering to be a subclass of Offering.So that has to be changed in the UML

To make things simpler, also added the fact that Lesson has a location. we must update that in UML too
