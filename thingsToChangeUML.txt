UPDATE 1: 
createOffering() in the system sequence diagram should have signature
(lesson, LOCATION, start time, endtime) instead of SCHEDULE. This is because
location HAS a schedule, so the organization is esentially asking to have a lesson
at a given location and then we check if that locatin's schedule works or not. 
^^^ There are other places this needs to be changed such as the sequence diagram for createOffering

The method ' takeOnOfferings()' has a real weird name for what it is supposed to do: 
It simply allows Instructor to VIEW the offerings published. so i renamed it to viewOfferings


- age validation for instructor and Client
- underage client features
- day of week lowercase and validation
- make sure time conflict validation works

- rethink design so that instructor can still see their offerings even when a booking has been made

- fix to string methods
