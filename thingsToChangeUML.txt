UPDATE 1: 
createOffering() in the system sequence diagram should have signature
(lesson, LOCATION, start time, endtime) instead of SCHEDULE. This is because
location HAS a schedule, so the organization is esentially asking to have a lesson
at a given location and then we check if that locatin's schedule works or not. 
^^^ There are other places this needs to be changed such as the sequence diagram for createOffering


The method ' takeOnOfferings()' has a real weird name for what it is supposed to do: 
It simply allows Instructor to VIEW the offerings published. so i renamed it to viewOfferings






To make things simpler, also added the fact that Lesson has a location. we must update that in UML too
